Firework Simulation Project
Author: Kyle Wilson

This is my firework simulation project.



TO WATCH VIDEO - 
 If you do not want to run the project or are having trouble running it then I attached a video of me using it as well as explaining how to run it
1. Click on file called: firework_video_example.mov
2. Press "Download" to download the file called firework_video_example.mov
3. Watch and enjoy!



TO ACCESS THE ACTUAL CODE:
1. Open the folders in this order: src -> main -> java -> com -> example -> animation
2. Open any of the .jar code files to see code



TO PLAY THE FIREWORK SIMULATION (ON MAC)
1. Open the folders in this order: out -> artifacts -> Animation_jar
2. Click on Animation.jar
3. Press "Download" to download the file called Animation.jar
4. Open terminal
5. In terminal type: java -jar
6. Press space then drag the Animation.jar file onto terminal screen and press enter
7. On my computer this looks like: java -jar /Users/kylewilson/Downloads/Animation.jar

After pressing enter the program should launch



TO PLAY THE FIREWORK SIMULATION (ON WINDOWS)
1. Open the folders in this order: out -> artifacts -> Animation_jar
2. Click on Animation.jar
3. Press "Download" to download the file called Animation.jar
4. Open command prompt
5. In command prompt type: java -jar
6. Then drag the Animation.jar file onto command prompt screen and press enter

After pressing enter the program should launch


 
FIREWORK SIMULATION FUNCTIONALITIES
1. Uses plenty of trigonometry to determine x and y velocities of firework, smoke trail, and particle dispersion
2. Uses random math to make every firework unique
3. Uses physics and elasticity calculations to simulate collision, gravity and momentum
4. Three different firework types
5. Color, angle, and launch power settings
6. Firework show option
7. And more!
